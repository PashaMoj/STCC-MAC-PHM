Optimal Design of "Shewhart-Type" Control Charts under "Multiple" Assignable Causes and "Proportional Hazards Model" as the Process Failure Mechanism

Description: This code is capable to be used for the economic and economic statistical design of Shewhart-type control charts with/under:
- multiple assignable causes,
- univariate and multivariate control statistics (e.g., Xbar and T2 Hotelling),
- normal and non-normal quality data in univariate cases,
- different hazard rates (costant, decreasing, increasing, bathtub, etc.),
- various process failure mechanisms or shock models (e.g., exponential, Weibull and Chen distributions) of proportional hazards models, and
- non-uniform sampling scheme with constant integrated hazard.
